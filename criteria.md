# User Evaluation Criteria
Participants who completed the User Evaluation had to hand in their app to ensure they had completed the task correctly. The User Evaluation Criteria is referenced from Chapter 7 of the thesis, Extracting technical domain knowledge to improve software architecture available [here](https://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/items/458ce762-3ba9-441c-a389-933640d828fb/1/).

Each app built as part of the user evaluation  was subject to the following criteria:

- The app had been built using RAPPT.
- There was no code in the unmodified tasks that had been added to the project.
- The app compiles and runs on the device without crashing.
- Yet Another Weather App displays the weather for a given city.
- Another Currency Exchange App fetches the appropriate currency.
- The modified app compiles and runs on the device.
- No additional functionality was added to the app.
